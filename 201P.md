# Introduction to Computer Security
## Definition of Security
> Memorize the case study instead of the plain definition of concept.  

Security of system, application, or protocol is **related** to  
* A set of desired properties - Security Goals
* An adversary with specific capabilities - Threads and Attacks  
### Security Goals - C.I.A
* Confidentiality - avoidance of unauthorized disclosure of info
    1. Encryption
    2. Access Control
    3. Authentication  
    Determin the identity of someone.
    4. Authorization  
    Determin the user's access to resources.  
        > Study case: Student, professor, TA see different pages after login canvas with UCI NetID.  

    1. Physical Security
* Integrity - avoidance of unauthorized info alteration
    1. Backups
    2. Check Sum
    3. Data Correction Codes
* Availability - info is accessable to authorized personal  
    1. Physical Protection
    2. Computational Redundancies
> Study case:  
> Confidentiality: Russia gets data from Ukraine military.
> Integrity: Change nuclear power plant sensors' data sent to control center.  
> Availability: Viasat terminals in Europe rendered inoperable as modems were attacked.  


### Other Security Topics - A.A.A
* Assurance
* Authenticity
* Anonymity

### Security Principles
Ideas that make a system safer.  


## 5 Important Implementations - WILL Appear in Exams
> Notations:  
> M - Message - Plain message  
> C - Cipher - Encrypted message  
> E[] - Encrypt function  
> D[] - Decrypt function  
> H - Hash value after Hash[] function  
> P - Public Key  
> S - Secret Key (symmetric or asymmetric)  
> i.e. $C = E_{P_A}[M]$ means **E**ncrypt **M**essage with user **A**'s **P**ublic key to get **C**ipher.  
> When denoting secret key in symmetric cryptography system, use subsript of both side $S_{AB}$  

### 1. Confidentiality using symmetric encryption 
Sender A and Receiver B shares secret key $S_{AB}$. As long as secret key is not compromised, the confidentiality of communication is ensured.    
Sender A Encrypts message M with secret key $C=E_{S_{AB}}[M]$  
Send Cipher C to Reciver B  
Receiver B Decrypts cipher with secret key $M=D_{S_{AB}}[C]$  
### 2. Confidentiality using asymmetric encryption  
Sender A has Public Key $Pu_{A}$ and Private Key $Pr_{A}$.  
Reciver B has Public Key $Pu_{B}$ and Private Key $Pr_{B}$.  
Public key is shared with all communication parties.  
Sender A Encrypts message M with B's Public Key $C=E_{Pu_{B}}[M]$  
Send Cipher C to Reciver B    
Reciver B Decrypts cipher with its private key $M=D_{Pr_{B}}[C]$  
### 3. Message authentication using symmetric encryption  
> Authentication ensures message integrity and authenticity.  
> Unless secret key is leaked, the man in the middle won't be able to change both orginal message and hash.  

Sender A generate Hash of message $H=Hash[M]$  
Sender A encrypt the hash with secret key $C=E_{S_{AB}}[Hash[M]]=E_{S_{AB}}[H]$  
Send original message M with encrypted hash $M||C$  
Receiver B calculates own hash of message $H'=Hash[M]$  
Receiver B decrypts cipher with secret key to get sender's message hash $D'=D_{S_{AB}}[C]$  
Compare $H'$ with $D'$
### 4. Message authentication using asymmetric encryption
Sender A generate Hash of message $H=Hash[M]$  
Sender A encrypt the hash with **its private key** $C=E_{Pr_{A}}[Hash[M]]=E_{Pr_{A}}[H]$  
Send original message M with encrypted hash $M||C$  
Receiver B calculates own hash of message $H'=Hash[M]$  
Receiver B decrypts cipher with sender's public key to get sender's message hash $D'=D_{Pu_{A}}[C]$  
Compare $H'$ with $D'$  
> Public key is accessible to everyone encluding attacker. To ensure the man in the middle can't generate the same authentication message, we use private key to encrypt the hash.  

### 5. Uer using asymmetric encryption - digital certificate  
CA - Certificate Agency is a entrusted third party, has $Pu_{CA}$ and $Pr_{CA}$  
The digitial certificate of A:  
The **hash** of A's **public key** signed by CA's **private key** $E_{Pr_{CA}}[Hash[Pu_{A}]]$  
For communiction party B, when it acquires A's public key and want to certify the authenticity of that, B decrypts the certificate with CA's public key and get the hash of authentic $Pu_{A}$. Compare the hash to certify A's public key. $H=D_{Pu_{CA}}[Cert_A]$  
> If CA's private key is compromised, attacker can sign certificate for malicious parties' public keys.

# Final Review
Majority in class exercise
## ICE4 RSA part:
1. Eulerâ€™s totient function
2. Euclidean algorithm, get gcd
3. Bizout's algorithm top down  
use the relationship in Euclidean algorithm's steps, bottom up  
other possible questions: the modification? multiplicative inverse of some number
4. RSA key gen, encrypt & decrypt
5. restriction of input smaller than n
## ICE3 AES part:
1. Special case multiply by 2, left shift, if most significant bit is 1, XOR with 0x1B
2. Polynomial multiplication
> Double check result with alternative shift and xor method  

3. AES Tranformation - sequential operation, use result from previous transformation as input
> mult 0x02 left shift, mult 0x03 = mult 0x02 & XOR orignal
