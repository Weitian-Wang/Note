# Introduction to Computer Security
## Definition of Security
> Memorize the case study instead of the plain definition of concept.  

Security of system, application, or protocol is **related** to  
* A set of desired properties - Security Goals
* An adversary with specific capabilities - Threads and Attacks  
### Security Goals - C.I.A
* Confidentiality - avoidance of unauthorized disclosure of info
    1. Encryption
    2. Access Control
    3. Authentication  
    Determin the identity of someone.
    4. Authorization  
    Determin the user's access to resources.  
        > Study case: Student, professor, TA see different pages after login canvas with UCI NetID.  

    1. Physical Security
* Integrity - avoidance of unauthorized info alteration
    1. Backups
    2. Check Sum
    3. Data Correction Codes
* Availability - info is accessable to authorized personal  
    1. Physical Protection
    2. Computational Redundancies
> Study case:  
> Confidentiality: Russia gets data from Ukraine military.
> Integrity: Change nuclear power plant sensors' data sent to control center.  
> Availability: Viasat terminals in Europe rendered inoperable as modems were attacked.  


### Other Security Topics - A.A.A
* Assurance
* Authenticity
* Anonymity

### Security Principles
Ideas that make a system safer.  


## 5 Important Implementations - WILL Appear in Exams
> Notations:  
> M - Message - Plain message  
> C - Cipher - Encrypted message  
> E[] - Encrypt function  
> D[] - Decrypt function  
> H - Hash value after Hash[] function  
> P - Public Key  
> S - Secret Key (symmetric or asymmetric)  
> i.e. $C = E_{P_A}[M]$ means **E**ncrypt **M**essage with user **A**'s **P**ublic key to get **C**ipher.  
> When denoting secret key in symmetric cryptography system, use subsript of both side $S_{AB}$  

### 1. Confidentiality using symmetric encryption  
### 2. Confidentiality using asymmetric encryption  
### 3. Message authentication using symmetric encryption  
### 4. Message authentication using asymmetric encryption  
### 5. Uer using asymmetric encryption - digital certificate
