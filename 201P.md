# Introduction to Computer Security
## Definition of Security
> Memorize the case study instead of the plain definition of concept.  

Security of system, application, or protocol is **related** to  
* A set of desired properties - Security Goals
* An adversary with specific capabilities - Threads and Attacks  
### Security Goals - C.I.A
* Confidentiality - avoidance of unauthorized disclosure of info
    1. Encryption
    2. Access Control
    3. Authentication  
    Determin the identity of someone.
    4. Authorization  
    Determin the user's access to resources.  
        > Study case: Student, professor, TA see different pages after login canvas with UCI NetID.  

    1. Physical Security
* Integrity - avoidance of unauthorized info alteration
    1. Backups
    2. Check Sum
    3. Data Correction Codes
* Availability - info is accessable to authorized personal  
    1. Physical Protection
    2. Computational Redundancies
> Study case:  
> Confidentiality: Russia gets data from Ukraine military.
> Integrity: Change nuclear power plant sensors' data sent to control center.  
> Availability: Viasat terminals in Europe rendered inoperable as modems were attacked.
