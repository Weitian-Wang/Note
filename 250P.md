Moore's Law
The number of transistors on an integrated circuit will double every two years.

   +

Dennard Scaling
As transistors get smaller, their power density stays constant.

The tech journalists' narrative:
"Hardware performace doubles each year."

### End of Moore's Law
Due to physical limitations and rising costs, the transistors can't be smaller.
### End of Dennard Scaling
$$
power \propto leakage_{(static)} + \alpha * {CFV^2}_{(dynamic)}\\ 
\alpha = constant\\ 
C = Capacitance\\ 
F = Frequency\\ 
V = Voltage\\ 
$$
> $\propto$: proportional to  

Idealy, as the size of transistor shrinks, voltage was reduced. So we can affort to operate the chip at higher frequency at the same power.  
However leakage power (static baseline power) is proportional to ${1}\over{voltage}$.  
Therefore power density of chip is increased as transistors get smaller.
### Solution
1. Multicore + Multithread - has limitations too!
2. Larger Chip - M1 Chip
3. Task specific chips - i.e. video encode/decode
