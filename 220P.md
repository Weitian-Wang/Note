# DBMS Goals
1. Efficiency and scalability
2. Management of large heterogeneous types of structured data
3. Reliability
4. Information sharing

## Schema vs Instance
Schema is the overall design, structure, and constraints.   
Instance is the set of data currently instantiated in the DB.  

## Relational Model
Model everything as a relation/tables.  
### Data Abstraction
Hiding physical storage details from users and programs. They can only see the high level representation
### Data Independence
- Logical data independence: protect application from changes to logical structure of data
- Physical data independence: protect application from changes to physical storage of data
### Data Definition Language(DDL)
Specification notation for defining the database schema.  
### Data Manipulation Language(DML)
Language for accessing and manipulating the data organized by the appropriate data model.  
Also known as query language.  
## DBMS Responsibilities
### Query Optimization
Find the cheapest evaluation strategy for a query.  

### Concurrency Control
Concurrent execution of user programs.  
1. Atomicity: all or nothing
2. Consistency
3. Isolation: partial effects of a transaction are hidden from each other
4. Durability

# Conceptual Modeling of Data
## Database Designing Process
## Entity/Relationship Model
ER Model is a simple pictorial model to specify the structure and semantics of data.  

### Entities
#### Concepts
- Entities: Nouns depicting things in real world
- Attributes: Properties of entities
- Entity Set:  A set of entities that have the same attributes
#### Constraints of Entity Sets
1. Key Constraint: A key is an attribute (or a set of attributes) that can uniquely identify an entity in an entity in an entity set. With each entity set, a notion of a key can be associated.  
2. Domain Constraint: The value of each attribute is constrained to be in the domain.  
Consider relationship set R between entity
### Relationships
#### Concepts
- Relationship: Association between multiple entities
- Relationship Attributes: Attributes associated with relationships
- Relationship Set: Set of relationships over the same entity sets
#### Constraints
1. Cardinality Constraint
2. Participation Constraint
#### Cardinality Constraints
Consider binary relationship set R between entity set A and B.  
1. One to one: an entity in A is associated with at most one entity in B, an entity in B is associated with at most one entity in A
2. Many to one: an entity in A is associated with at most one entity in B, an entity in B can be associated with many entities in A
3. Many to many: an entity in A can be associated with many entities in B, an entity in B can be associated with many entities in A  

In the ER diagram, arrows are pointed to the one ends in relationships.  
#### Participation Constraints
Participation of an entity set A in the relationship set R_a can be total. Each entity in entity set A is constrained to be related to other entities via relationship R_a.  

Total participation is also called existential dependency.  

In ER diagram, total participation is represented using a double line between the relationship and entity set that totally participates in the relationship. The relationship is many to one where the strong entity is the one end and the weak entity is the many end. 

A great example for weak entities is the entity relationship model of street, city, and state. 

### Weak Entity Set
Entity set that do not have sufficient attributes to form a key. 

## Relational Model
Everything(entity set and relationship set) are all modeled as a relation.
### Concepts 
- Relation: A collection of tuples/rows, more specifically a set with no duplicates
- Relation Schema: relation(attr1, attr2, ...)
- Attribute: Each attribute has a domain 
- Row: a set of attribute values
### Database Schema
A database schema consists of:
1. A set of relation schemas, S = (R1, R2, ..., Rn)
2. A set of constraints over relation schemas

### Superkey
A superkey is a set of attributes that can uniquely identify tuples in a table.  
### Candidate Key
Candidate key is a superkey that is minimal.  
### Constraints
- Domain Constraint
- Key Constraint
- Function Dependency (generalization of Key Constraint)
- Entity Identity Constraint
- Referential Integrity Constraint/ Foreign Key Constrain
- Inclusion Dependency (generalization of Referential Integrity)
### Inclusion Dependency
Generalization of referential integrity constraints.  
Values in relation S refer to values in relation R:  
$$S[Y_1,\dots, Y_n]\subseteq R[X_1,\dots, X_n]$$
### Functional Dependency
#### Definition
Given Relation $R(A_1, \dots, A_n, B_1, \dots, B_m, C_1, \dots, C_p)$.  

$A_1, \dots, A_n$ functionally determine $B_1, \dots, B_m$, is denoted by $A_1, \dots, A_n \rarr B_1, \dots, B_m$.  

This means for any two tuples r1 and r2 in R, $r1(A_1, \dots, A_n) = r2(A_1, \dots, A_n)$ implies $r1(B_1, \dots, B_m) = r2(B_1, \dots, B_m)$.  

#### Types of Functional Dependency
Consider function $X_1 X_2\dots X_n \rarr Y_1 Y_2\dots Y_m$  
1. Trivial Dependency: Y's is subset of X's, $AB\rarr A$
2. Nontrivial: At least one of the Y's are not among the X's, $AB\rarr AC$
3. Completely Nontrivial: None of the Y's in X's, $AB\rarr C$

We can always change a set of FDs to its completely nontrivial equivalent.

### BCNF
#### Definition
Definition of Boyce Codd Normal Form.  
Let $R$ be the relation scheme. $F$ be the functional dependency set.  
$R$ is BCNF if for all functional dependency $X\rarr Y$ in $F$, either  
1. Y is a subset of X, the definition of trivial dependency
2. X is superkey  

> Definition of superkey: $X$ is superkey if $X\rarr A_1,\ A_2,\ \dots,\ A_n$ is in $F$ and the right hand side is the whole set of attributes of R  

#### Armstrong's Axioms and Additional
1. Reflectivity: if $Y$ is subset of $X$, then $X\rarr Y$ 
2. Augmentation: if $X\rarr Y$ then $XZ\rarr YZ$  
3. Transitivity: if $X\rarr Y$ and $Y\rarr Z$, then $X\rarr Z$  
4. Union Rule: if $X\rarr Y$ and $X\rarr Z$, then $X\rarr YZ$  

#### Closure of Functional Dependency Set
Let $F$ be a set of Functional Dependencies of a relation $R$. $F+ = \{X\rarr Y | \text{F logically implies X}\rarr \text{Y}\}$ is the closure of $F$. $F+$ denotes the set of all Functional Dependencies that must hold over $R$.
#### Check of BCNF
[By definition](#definition-1) for each nontrivial functional dependency $X\rarr Y$ check if $X$ is a superkey.  

To check if a relation is BCNF, use Armstrong's Axioms to get the closure of each functional dependency.  

### Lossless Decomposition
Let R be the relation schema and let (R1, R2, ..., Rn) be its decomposition.  

Lossless decomposition allows us to reconstruct instance of R using natural joins.  
#### Test for Lossless
Let R1 and R2 be a decomposition of R.  
The decomposition is lossless if either of the following holds:  

$$R1\cap R2\rarr R1 - R2$$
$$R1\cap R2\rarr R2 - R1$$

The shared attributes between the two sub-relations can functionally determine the rest of the attributes.  
## Convert ER Model to Relational Model
!!TODO!!

## Relational Algebra
#Relational Algebra is a simple algebraic operator based language for writing queries over relational databases.  

### Selection
$\sigma _c(R)$ returns tuples in R that satisfy condition C.
### Projection
$\Pi _{A1,\dots, Ak}(R)$ picks columns of attributes A1 to Ak of R.
### Renaming
$\rho _{a/b}(R)$ renames attribute b to a, to disambiguate same attribute names from different relations.  
### Union
$R_A\cup R_B$ returns all tuples in two relation sets.
### Intersection
$R_A\cap R_B$ return overlapping tuples in two relation sets. 
### Difference
$R_A - R_B$ return the set difference between two relation sets. 
### Cartesian Production
$R\times S$ pairs each tuple r in R with each tuple s in S. 
### Join
$$R\overset{\bowtie}{c}S = \sigma _c (R\times S)$$
Join two sets on join condition C.  
#### Theta Join
A theta join is a join based on binary relational operator $\theta$ in {$\le, \leq, =, \gt, \geq$}.  
In case the operator $\theta$ is $=$ the join is equijoin.
#### Equi-Join
When the operator $\theta$ is $=$ in the Theta Join. 
#### Natural Join
Join of two relations on condition that all their common attributes are equal.

# Structured Query Language
## Data Definition Language
Covered earlier.
## Query Language
### SELECT
1. **SELECT** specifies the attributes to project onto. Use * to select all attributes.  
2. Use the keyword **DISTINCT** on attributes to explicitly eliminate duplicates.  
3. Use **SELECT Table.Attr AS A** to rename the result column.  
4. Arithmetic operators can be used on attributes.  

### FROM
1. **FROM** specifies which relation to select the attributes from. 
2. Use **FROM TABLE AS T** to rename the table, useful for avoiding ambiguity. 

### WHERE
1. **WHERE** specifies conditions.
2. Comparison operators and logical operators can be used in the condition expression
3. Use **LIKE** to match string pattern. **%** matches zero, one or more occurrences of any characters; Underscore **_** is a one character wildcard.
4. Use relation prefix to disambiguate attribute names.
   ```sql
   SELECT patient.name
   FROM patient, diagnosis
   WHERE patient.name = diagnosis.name
   ```
5. **BETWEEN** operator 
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM outcome
   WHERE time_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-03-01'
   ```

### ORDER BY
1. **ORDER BY Attr** sorts the result in ascending order on the given attribute
2. Support sort on multiple attributes
3. Control the ascending or descending of the result with **ASC** and **DESC** keywords
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Customers
    ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;
    ```

### AGGREGATION
1. **MIN, MAX, SUM, COUNT, AVG** takes a collection of records and return a single aggregated row
2. Use **COUNT(DISTINCT ATTRIBUTE)** to eliminate duplicates. 
  
### GROUP BY
**GROUP BY** can be used so that aggregation is applied to each group separately.
```sql
-- count the number of diagnosis for each disease
SELECT disease, count(name)
FROM diagnosis
GROUP BY disease
```

### HAVING 
**HAVING** should be used with **GROUP BY** to filter attributes after aggregation.  
```sql
-- find customer with over 10 orders
SELECT customer, count(order_id)
FROM order
GROUP BY customer
HAVING count(order_id) > 10
```
## Condition Involving Relations
### ALL
```sql
s > ALL(R)
```
Denotes the condition where s is greater than *every* value in relation R
### IN
```sql
s IN(R)
```
s equals to at least one value in R.
### ANY or SOME
**ANY** and **SOME** are used synonymously in SQL.
```sql
s > ANY(R)
```
Condition where s is greater than at least one element in relation R.
### EXISTS
```sql
EXISTS(R)
```
Relation R is not empty. Usually used on the result of a subsquery.
### NOT
All of the above condition keywords can be negated using the **NOT** keyword.  

## More Query Languages
### Subquery
SQL allows a subquery expression to be used in the **FROM** clause.  
Rename the result subquery to eliminate ambiguity in the **SELECT** clause.   
### WITH
The **WITH** clause can to create temporary tables, which are further used in the main query.  
### Join
1. **JOIN** can be implicitly implemented with **SELECT FROM WHERE** combination
    ```sql
    SELECT attr
    FROM table1, table2
    WHERE table1.attr = table2.attr
    ```
2. Join can also be expressed using **JOIN** keyword
#### CROSS JOIN
**CROSS JOIN** produces a Cartesian Production
#### JOIN ON
Join two tables on condition. 
```sql
-- the equivalent of implicit join
SELECT attr 
FROM table1 JOIN table2 
ON table1.attr = table2.attr
```
#### NATURAL JOIN 
**NATURAL JOIN** joins two tables based on shared attribute name and datatype.

### Modification
#### Insert
```sql
INSERT INTO Relation Values (v1, v2, ..., vn)
```
#### Delete
```sql
DELETE FROM Relation WHERE Conditions
```
#### Update
```sql
UPDATE Relation SET Assignments WHERE Conditions
```
## Advanced SQL
### Constraint
#### Primary Key
```sql
CREATE TABLE Patients 
( 
  id 	int Primary Key,
  name	char(15),
  dob	date
);

-- alternative
CREATE TABLE Patiente
(
  id int,
  name char(15),
  dob date,
  Primary Key(id)
);
```
#### Candidate Key
```sql
CREATE TABLE Patients 
( 
  id	int,
  name	char(15),
  dob	date,
  Unique (name)
);
```
#### Foreign Key
```sql
CREATE TABLE Patients 
( 
  ...
  id int REFERENCES Person(ssn);
  ...
);

-- alternative
CREATE TABLE Patients
( 
  ...
  id int,
  ...
  FOREIGN KEY id REFERENCES Person(ssn);
);
```
#### Attribute-Based Checks
Apply constraints on attribute values. 

```sql
-- grammar
-- CHECK(predicate)

CREATE TABLE  Outcomes
(
  ...
  test  char(15),
  result  char(5) CHECK (result in ('true', 'false')),
  testdate date CHECK (testdate >= '2022-01-01' AND testdate <'2023-01-01')
  ...
);
```
### Trigger
Triggers enable database programmers to specify when to check a constraint and what exactly to do.  [Trigger Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/176OS-_eaPDKoqXEN-6tFSsAVcmXvPCNM/edit#slide=id.p21).
#### Components
1. An **Event**
2. A **Condition**
3. An **Action**, which can be performed row-level or statement-level

When the event happens, the system will check the conditions, perform the actions if conditions satisfied.  

#### Timing
1. BEFORE
2. AFTER 
3. INSTEAD OF 

#### Row Level Trigger 
Perform trigger action once for each tuple
```sql
-- Create a row level trigger that no update can reduce salary
CREATE TRIGGER NoLowerSalary
AFTER UPDATE ON employee
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF (OLD.salary > NEW.salary) THEN
        SET salary = OLD.salary
    END IF;
END;
```
#### Statement Level Trigger
Perform trigger action for each transaction (statement)
```sql
-- Whenever we insert employees ensure that their department_id exists in department
CREATE TRIGGER DeptExist
AFTER INSERT ON employee
BEGIN
    IF (EXISTS (SELECT * FROM NEW_TABLE WHERE department_id NOT IN department)) THEN 
    DELETE FROM employee
    WHERE department_id NOT IN department;
    END IF;
END;
```
### View
View is the top layer of the three-schema architecture. [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/176OS-_eaPDKoqXEN-6tFSsAVcmXvPCNM/edit#slide=id.p28).
```
┌───────┐  ┌───────┐  ┌───────┐
│ View1 │  │ View2 │  │ View3 │
└───────┘  └───┬───┘  └───────┘
        \      │     /
         ┌─────┴─────┐
         │           │
         │ Logical   │
         │           │
         └─────┬─────┘
               │
         ┌─────┴─────┐
         │           │
         │ Physical  │
         │           │
         └───────────┘
```
Views are virtual relations which means they are not stored physically.   
```sql
CREATE VIEW <name> AS <query>;
```

## Transaction
Transaction is the consistent and failure resilient execution of database applications.  
### ACID
1. Atomicity: No partial effects
2. Consistency: Correct execution data and satisfies database constraint
3. Isolation: Partial effects of transaction hidden from other transactions
4. Durability: Failure resistant

### Concurrency
Increase throughput and reduce latency.

### Implement Transaction
1. Concurrency Control Protocols
    - Locking Protocols
    - Timestamp Based
    - Validation  

2. Recovery Algorithm
3. Atomic Commit Protocols
  
### Locks
Transaction acquires a lock on data item `d` before accessing `d`, which could be a record, set of records, or table.   
- **S** lock for reads, does not conflict with another **S** lock
- **X** lock for updates, conflicts with both **S** and **X** lock

#### Two Phase Locking Protocol
Transactions acquire **all** their lock before relinquishing **any** of the locks they acquire. The Two Phase Locking ensures that concurrent execution of transactions is equivalent to sequential executions.  
Two Phase:   
1. Acquire phase
2. Release phase

#### Rigorous 2PL
Keep acquiring appropriate locks as needed, release all locks when you commit.

### Logging
#### Redo Log
Redo log is used to recover correct data by incomplete transactions. 
#### Undo Log
Logs used to reconstruct old data in case the transaction aborts.

### Atomic Commit Protocol
Atomic commit protocol ensures that transaction commits or aborts all sites in case of failure.
